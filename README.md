Hyperion aims to have 10k players PvP simultaneously on a Minecraft server to break the Guinness World Record. The
architecture is ECS-driven using [Flecs Rust](https://github.com/Indra-db/Flecs-Rust). To contribute,
join [Hyperion's Discord](https://discord.gg/sTN8mdRQ) for the latest updates on development.

# Running

## Step 1: The proxy

Go to `hyperion-proxy` and install it with `cargo install --path .`

## Step 2: The event (development)

```bash
brew install just
just debug
```

# Local CI

```
just
```

# Development

## Recommendations

- Wurst client
    - great for debugging and also rejoining with running `just debug`. I usually have an AutoReconnect time of 0
      seconds.
- Supermaven. great code completion.
