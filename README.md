Hyperion aims to have 10k players PvP simultaneously on one Minecraft world to break the Guinness World Record (8825 by EVE Online). The
architecture is ECS-driven using [Flecs Rust](https://github.com/Indra-db/Flecs-Rust). To contribute,
join [Hyperion's Discord](https://discord.gg/sTN8mdRQ) for the latest updates on development.

Our current efforts are focused on making an event roughly similar to something that would be
on [Overcast Network](https://oc.tc/) (we are not affiliated with them).
